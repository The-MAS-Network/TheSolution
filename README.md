**PART 1: The Solution Web Mobile Application Open Source Project Competition Rules and Guidelines**

**Note:** 
For Part 1, the first 2 submissions that follow the guidelines correctly will be awarded and announced.


**Objective:** Develop a web application for both mobile and web view based on the provided Figma designs:

**Mobile View Link:** https://www.figma.com/file/RUFBEsbS5RS78bS541rbbu/Community-Design-Access-File?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design

**Desktop View Link:** https://www.figma.com/file/RUFBEsbS5RS78bS541rbbu/Community-Design-Access-File?type=design&node-id=43-11637&mode=design&t=0oC9PkPNFbMHP9kg-4

**Functionalities Brief Overview:** 
Includes the Profile Section, language change, and a fully operational Sign Up/Sign In section with a Lightning Address (not email address).
